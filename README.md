# _Make IT Count_
#### An api for tracking various types of businesses and their associations to charities {Jan. 26, 2017}
#### by _**Aaron Ross**_

## Description

This is the logic for an api that will allow an app maintain a database of business types that are associated with charities. It will also allow the user to create a "tour" of any set of the businesses and get google maps directions api data for the route specified.  It was created for my epicodus java class to demonstrate usage of spark, one to many java object relations, many to many java object relations, abstract classes, interface implementation, object inheritance, custom exceptions, Sql2o, PostgreSQL, DAO or data access object oriented layout, CRUD functionality and RESTful routing.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Download the most recent java APK and JRE
* run App.java with IntelliJ IDEA or similar compiler/editor
* run App.java
* use a service like Postman to send requests at the api to see what it can do

## Support and Contact Info

If you have any questions or concerns please contact me via email: ashmortar@gmail.com

## Further Exploration
* several methods have been created that routes have not yet been written to take adavantage of.  These include sorting by a business type.
* once implemented this will allow sorting to be combined so that a user could, for instance, request all of the bars associated with a charity, then produce a pub crawl route that visits those establishments

## Technologies Used

* Java
* IntelliJ IDEA
* Gradle
* Junit testing package
* Spark java framework
* PostgreSQL
* H2 db engine
* Sql2o
* google maps directions api
